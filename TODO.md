# Footer Positioning Fix

## Task Overview
Move the footer div to be the last child inside the main content container in all affected HTML files to prevent it from appearing as a column on the right side, ensure it doesn't cover the nav, and allow proper scrolling.

## Affected Files
- svymfrontend/admin_dashboard.html
- svymfrontend/admin_students.html
- svymfrontend/admin_courses.html
- svymfrontend/admin_reports.html
- svymfrontend/admin_fee_details.html
- svymfrontend/admin_field_mobilisers.html
- svymfrontend/admin_trainers.html

## Steps
1. Analyze each file's structure to identify the main content container.
2. Move `<div id="footer"></div>` to be the last child inside the main content div/container.
3. Verify scrolling works by checking CSS (e.g., overflow settings).
4. Test changes if possible.
